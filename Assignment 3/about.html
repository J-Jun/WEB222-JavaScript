    <h1><u>About</u></h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    I am a student in Seneca College majoring in Computer Programming and Analysis (CPA). Before I got into the field of programming, I used to study fields of mathematics 
    and statistics.Through the assignment of the WEB222, I was able to look into an area of animals that I have been interested in so long. I chose <b>Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher</b> 
    as my animal because the bird intrigued me as I was scrolling down. Moreover, the Gnatcatchers were really cute and the nest was familiar to me, but after studying them
    had me realize that I was thinking of wrong nest. The way Gnatcher survived in the wild was also interesting. Through this assignment, I was able to learn a lot and 
    catch up on some HTML I have been lacking. I am more interested in the future assingments and excited to learn CSS and use it with JavaScript and HTML.
