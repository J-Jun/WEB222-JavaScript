    <h1><u>Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher</u></h1>
    <br /><br />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher is a tiny bird that lives in forests. <br />
    Gnatcatchers also have a scientific name which is <i>Polioptila caerulea</i>. <br />
    Gnatcatcher’s size on average is quite small, where the length is between 10-13cm, a wingspan of 16cm, and weight in between 5-7g. <br />
    Comparing to other birds, the size of the Gnatcatcher is around sparrow or smaller. <br />

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Appearance</h2>

    Gnatcatchers have an ideal shape of having long legs, a long tail, a thin, straight bill, and a white eye-ring. <br />
    However, different genders have their own special identification. <br /><br />

    Adult males have:
        <ul>
            <li>Blue & Gray Upperparts</li>
            <li>White Underparts</li>
            <li>A Slender Dark Bill</li>
            <li>A Long Black Tail (edged in white)</li>
        </ul>
    During summer, male Gnatcatchers have a black V-shaped on their foreheads. <br />
    Adult females are less blue, while baby females are greenish-gray. <br />

    <h2>Migration</h2>

    When Gnatcatchers migrate, they tend to spread out through the southern United States, Mexico, northern Central America, Cuba, Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Caymans Islands.
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Calling / Song</h2>

    When Gnatcatchers sing a song or call another gnatcatcher, they are often heard around breeding grounds, away from the nest, and usually just heard sometime of the year. <br />
    The songs and calls vary and some of them are as if they are wheezing the sounds through nasal.

    <h2>Habitat</h2>

    Gnatcatchers as mentioned live in forests, but in detail, they live in deciduous forests, often in moister areas. <br />
    Also, not only they in the forest but they live in shrublands.
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Breeding</h2>
    Their breeding habitat includes the areas in southern Ontario, the eastern and southwestern United Stated States, and Mexico. <br />
    When they choose locations to breed, Eastern North America is the only location where they will breed. <br />
    When building small cup nests for breeding, both male and female Gnatcatchers cooperate. <br />
    Materials used to create it are weeds, animal hair, feathers, barks, and plant fibers. <br />
    Moreover, to stay hidden and safe within the forest, Gnatcatchers camouflage the outer nest using spiderwebs and some pieces of lichen. <br />
    When building nests, Gnatcatchers build them between 3 – 25 feet above the ground. <br />

    Female Gnatcatchers lay around 4-6 eggs or sometimes 3-6. <br />
    Each egg is pale blue colored usually with brown dots on them. <br />
    Both parents incubate their eggs for between 11-15 days, but usually 13 days. <br />
    At first, females incubate the eggs while the male hunts for food and come back with them. <br />
    When young Gnatcatchers are hatched, they are born naked and helpless with eyes closed and very little movement. <br />
    The young Gnatcatchers leave their nest approximately 10-15 days after they hatch. <br />
    Per year, 1 or 2 broods are created. <br /><br />

    Here is a small clip of an adult Gnatcatcher feeding baby Gnatcatchers: <br /><br />

    <h2>Predators / Prey</h2>

    Even though the adult Gnatcatchers have a couple of predators, the nestlings, and eggs could be taken by jays, magpies, and woodpeckers. <br />
    Sometimes they are taken by snakes, crows, raccoons, and other organisms. <br />
    When Gnatcatchers hunt for food, their prey are usually hidden or inside trees or shrubs. <br />
    Their diet is a wide variety of small insects, insect eggs, and spiders. <br />
    Some examples of their food are:

        <ul>
            <li>Moths</li>
            <li>Beetles</li>
            <li>Butterflies</li>
            <li>Caterpillars</li>
            <li>Many Different Kinds of Spiders</li>
        </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>

    Gnatcatchers have a couple of interesting facts about them:

        <ul>
            <li>Their breeding range is expanding towards the north, especially within North America.</li>
            <li>When hunting for food, they flick their tails, and the movement may scare the insects that are hiding due to the white color at the edge of their tails</li>
            <li>When hunting a big bug, they first tear off their wings and injure the bugs until they can’t move or die.</li>
            <li>A pair of Gnatcatchers can build up to seven nests during a breeding season. Gnatcatchers have a nickname, which is <b><i>Little Mockingbird</i></b>.</li>
        </ul>
